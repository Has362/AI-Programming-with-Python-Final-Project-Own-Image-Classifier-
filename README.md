Create Your Own Image Classifier

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed the Create Your Own Image Classifier project as part of my learning journey with Udacity as part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI&ML Scholarship! ðŸŽ‰

This project allowed me to dive deep into AI and machine learning, training a neural network to classify images into 102 categories of flowers ðŸŒºðŸŒ»ðŸŒ·. Through this experience, I've gained hands-on skills in data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation using PyTorch, while also applying techniques like transfer learning and image augmentation.

This milestone reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field of AI.

This README file provides a brief overview of the project, including its objectives, methodology, and key findings.

Project Objectives:

Build and train a deep learning model to classify images of flowers.
Explore and implement data preprocessing techniques.
Utilize transfer learning for efficient model training.
Evaluate model performance and identify areas for improvement.
Methodology:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected and organized a dataset of flower images.
Performed data cleaning and augmentation techniques (e.g., resizing, cropping, flipping).
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Development:

Utilized a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG) as a base.
Fine-tuned the pre-trained model on the flower image dataset.
Implemented custom layers and modifications to the base architecture.
Training and Evaluation:

Trained the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., cross-entropy).
Monitored training progress using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Evaluated model performance on the validation and test sets.
Key Findings:

Transfer learning significantly improved model accuracy and training efficiency.
Data augmentation techniques helped to improve model generalization and robustness.
The chosen CNN architecture demonstrated strong performance on the flower image classification task.
Future Work:

Explore more advanced CNN architectures and hyperparameter tuning techniques.
Investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation.
Deploy the trained model to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS) for real-time image classification.
This project has provided valuable insights into the power of deep learning for image classification and has solidified my understanding of key AI/ML concepts.

I encourage you to explore the project code and experiment with different techniques. Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions.



# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
